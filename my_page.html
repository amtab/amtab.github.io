    <h4 class="media-heading">Naked by David Sedaris</h4>
    <p> A tart-tongued mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics,
       to the great amusement of his teachers; a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a
       quadriplegic companion; a family gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death. Through it all is Sedaris's unmistakable voice,
       without doubt one of the freshest in American writing - Amazon.com </p>
       <h4> My Recomendation <h4>
         Get this book! Its harilously dark, raw, and brutal. David Sedaris takes memoires from childhood we would all have liked to blank from our
         minds and puts them together in a smart non chronological tale that will light up that deep dark part of your mind with glee. Its pretty much fun for the whole dysfunctional family.<strong> 10/10!</strong>
